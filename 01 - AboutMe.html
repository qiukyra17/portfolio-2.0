                    How things work has always peaked my curiosity in different things. How are websites and apps
                    created, how are they designed, and how does it communicate what the user wants to the owner of the
                    brand? I become a toddler, in the endless amount of questions about how and why?
                </p>
                <p class="chatBubbleResponse scrollTarget" style=" animation: fadeIn 1s ease 1s forwards;">
                    Shopping online has become huge for this generation, and everyone has experienced fair share of
                    good, and bad experiences. I noticed that good user experience paired with good user interface,
                    makes it an ease, and we as consumers donâ€™t say much about them, because this should be the norm.
                    But, on the other hand, a website or application that is terrible, becomes memorable, where we avoid
                    at all cost, because if it was an e-commerce site, placing a simple order would be impossible.
                </p>
                <p class="chatBubbleResponse scrollTarget" style=" animation: fadeIn 1.5s ease 1.5s forwards;">
                    I want to contribute to creating good user experience through a good user interface. Studying as an
                    art major for most of my education has helped me understand functionality and aesthetics, how to
                    achieve best of both worlds. But, I lacked the technical skills or creating an application.

                    So, I applied to a working boot-camp, Revature, it was a 10-Week Full Stack Software Engineer
                    Course. They taught me everything from back-end to front-end, specializing in Java/Angular tech
                    stack. Dabbling a bit into cloud services too. We created several full stack applications as
                    individuals, and as a team.
                </p>

                    Training is done, I am ready to continue to learn, and I am looking for my next step in this new the
                    career path.
